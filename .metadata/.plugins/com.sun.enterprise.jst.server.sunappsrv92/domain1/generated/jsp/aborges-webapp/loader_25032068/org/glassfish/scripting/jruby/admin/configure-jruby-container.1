NAME
     configure-jruby-container - configures the Enterprise Server
     JRuby container

SYNOPSIS
     configure-jruby-container [--help]
     [--monitoring={false|true}]
     [--jruby-home jruby-home]
     [--jruby-runtime jruby-runtime]
     [--jruby-runtime-min jruby-runtime-min]
     [--jruby-runtime-max jruby-runtime-max]
     [--show={true|false}]

DESCRIPTION
     The  configure-jruby-container  subcommand  configures   the
     JRuby  container  of Sun GlassFishTM Enterprise Server. This
     subcommand also shows the current settings of the Enterprise
     Server JRuby container.

     The Enterprise Server JRuby container enables JRuby applica-
     tions to be deployed in Enterprise Server.

     JRuby is an implementation of the Ruby programming  language
     in  the  JavaTM language. JRuby consists of the JRuby inter-
     preter, the Ruby library, and Ruby gems. JRuby is  available
     from   Update   Tool   or  from  the  JRuby  community  site
     (http://jruby.org).

     The Enterprise Server JRuby container maintains  a  pool  of
     JRuby  runtime  instances for use by JRuby applications. The
     configure-jruby-container subcommand enables you to set  the
     initial  size,  minimum size, and maximum size of this pool.
     The minimum size must be greater than zero. The initial size
     must  be  greater than or equal to the minimum size and less
     than or equal to the maximum size.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

asadmin Utility Subcommands          configure-jruby-container(1)

         Server JRuby container. The default is false.

     --jruby-home

         The directory where JRuby  itself  (not  the  Enterprise
         Server JRuby container) is installed.

         The directory must exist. Otherwise,  an  error  occurs.
         However,  the subcommand does not check whether JRuby is
         installed in the directory.

         The default is as-install/jruby, which is the  directory
         where  Update  Tool  installs  JRuby.  Therefore, if you
         obtained JRuby from Update  Tool,  this  option  is  not
         required.

     --jruby-runtime
         The initial number of JRuby  runtime  instances  in  the
         pool.

         This number must be greater than zero, greater  than  or
         equal  to --jruby-runtime-min, and less than or equal to
         --jruby-runtime-max.

         The default is 1.

     --jruby-runtime-min

         The minimum number of JRuby  runtime  instances  in  the
         pool.

         This number must be greater than zero, and less than  or
         equal to --jruby-runtime and --jruby-runtime-max.

         The default is 1.

     --jruby-runtime-max
         The maximum number of JRuby  runtime  instances  in  the
         pool.

         This number must be greater than zero, and greater  than
         or equal to --jruby-runtime and --jruby-runtime-min.

         The default is 1.

     --show

         If set to true, displays the  current  settings  of  the

         Enterprise Server JRuby container. The default is true.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Setting the Directory Where JRuby Is Installed

     This example sets the directory where JRuby is installed  to
     /tools/jruby.

       asadmin> configure-jruby-container --jruby-home=/tools/jruby
       Successfully updated jruby-home to the new value: /tools/jruby

       Current JRuby Container configuration:
       jruby-home=/tools/jruby
       max-pool-size=1
       initial-pool-size=1
       min-pool-size=1
       monitoring=false

       Command configure-jruby-container executed successfully.

     Example 2 Configuring the JRuby Runtime Pool

     This example configures the JRuby runtime pool as follows:

         o    The initial number of JRuby  runtime  instances  in
              the pool is 3.

         o    The minimum number of JRuby  runtime  instances  in
              the pool is 2.

         o    The maximum number of JRuby  runtime  instances  in
              the pool is 5.

     The current settings of the  Enterprise  Server  JRuby  Con-
     tainer are not displayed.

       asadmin> configure-jruby-container --show=false
       --jruby-runtime=3
       --jruby-runtime-min=2
       --jruby-runtime-max=5
       Successfully updated JRuby runtime pool configuration. Updated values are,
       jruby-runtime: 3, jruby-runtime-min: 2, jruby-runtime-max: 5

     Example 3 Displaying the Current Settings of the  Enterprise
     Server JRuby Container

     This command displays the current settings of an  Enterprise
     Server JRuby container that is configured as follows:

         o    The  directory  where   JRuby   is   installed   is
              /tools/jruby.

         o    The initial number of JRuby  runtime  instances  in
              the pool is 3.

         o    The minimum number of JRuby  runtime  instances  in
              the pool is 2.

         o    The maximum number of JRuby  runtime  instances  in
              the pool is 5.

         o    Monitoring for the  Enterprise  Server  JRuby  Con-
              tainer is not enabled.
